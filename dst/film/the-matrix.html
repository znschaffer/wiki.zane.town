<h1 id="the-matrix">The Matrix</h1>
<p>“What is the matrix”</p>
<h2 id="matrix-vs-real-world-form">Matrix vs Real-World Form</h2>
<p>Matrix is <em>Green</em>, Real-World is <em>Blue</em>. Matrix is
bright with harsh lighting, real-world is uniformly dark. Costumes are
intricate and bold in the Matrix, shaggy rags in real-world.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Motivation: search for the truth</p>
<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
<h3 id="neo">Neo</h3>
<p>Works at <em>Metacortex</em> at the start of the film; software
company mega-corp. Reprimanded for tardiness at work - “every employee
must stay in line”</p>
<p>“Personal Jesus Christ” - Choi Follow the white rabbit</p>
<p>On a search for Morpheus - relates to Trinity.</p>
<p>Gets “bugged” by the agents - a literal stomach bug.</p>
<p>After leaving matrix and ‘unplugging’ is <em>dead</em> for 3 days and
reborn. Sitting on operating table in pure white while angelic music
plays.</p>
<h3 id="trinity">Trinity</h3>
<h3 id="morpheus">Morpheus</h3>
<h3 id="cypher">Cypher</h3>
<h3 id="agent-smith">Agent Smith</h3>
<h3 id="agent-smith-1">Agent Smith</h3>
<h2 id="agents">Agents</h2>
<p>They use the police to help them enact control and take custody of
Neo and other people not keeping ‘in-line’</p>
<p>Bureaucratic looking. Try to convince Neo that Morpheus is evil and
dangerous.</p>
<p>Can change the matrix to help them trap the free people. Can change
at any point. There’s a ‘glitch’ when they change it - deja vu.</p>
<p>Disgusted by the real humans, they can ‘taste their stink, saturated
by it’.</p>
<p>They keep “deadnaming” Neo by calling him Mr Anderson</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My name is”Neo”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrix">Matrix</h2>
<p>Is everywhere, all around us.</p>
<p>Billions of people just living out their lives, oblivious.</p>
<p>The first matrix: design to be perfect - everyone was happy. It
didn’t work because human beings desire misery and suffering.</p>
<p>Control-based</p>
<p>Built to turn humans into “batteries”.</p>
<p>Humans built AI - Machines needed energy, they started growing humans
and using them for energy.</p>
<p>Original person was born in the matrix and freed the first people.
After he died the prophet saw his return - to free the rest of humanity
from the matrix.</p>
<p>Most of these peoples re not ready to be unplugged - they are so in
need of the system they’ll fight to save it.</p>
<p>The matrix can’t tell you who you are.</p>
<p>The solution to this capitalist hell is to shoot your problems away.
When Neo and Trinity go to save Morpheus they need to shoot and kill
hundreds of people in an office building.</p>
<h2 id="zion">Zion</h2>
<p>Last human city - deep underground. Tank and Dosser were born
there.</p>
<h2 id="morpheus-1">Morpheus</h2>
<p>Their ship is called the <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>, a Babylonian king
who <strong>conquered Assyria, Egypt, and Judah</strong>, but his most
famous conquest is that of Jerusalem, which is recorded in the Bible.
Some refer to him as a ruthless, cruel king who destroyed Jerusalem and
forced the Jewish people into exile.</p>
<p>Oracle predicts Morpheus will sacrifice his life for new’s life. Noe
gets to choose which one will die.</p>
<p><em>Residual Self Image</em> - mental projection of digital self</p>
<h2 id="trinity-1">Trinity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I thought you were a man.” -Noe “Most men do.” - Trinity</p>
