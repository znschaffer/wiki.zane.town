# Function Transformation

**IHOP**
: **I**nside, **H**orizontal, **Op**posite

$Af(B(x + C)) + D$

$A$: Vertical Stretch/Compression

$B$: Horizontal Stretch/Compression

$C$: Horizontal Shift

$D$: Vertical Shift

## Shifts

Seen through addition or subtraction either "inside" (horizontal) or
"outside" (vertical) the function.

$f(x) = x^2 + 2$ has a vertical shift up 2 units

$f(x) = (x - 4)^2$ has a horizontal shift right 4 units

## Stretches and Compressions

Seen through multiplication either "inside" (horizontal) or "outside"
(vertical) the function.

$f(x) = 2(x)^2$ is vertically stretched by 2.

$f(x) = (2x)^2$ is horizontally compressed by 2.

## Combining Transformations

When dealing with multiple transformations, factor the equation out to
$Af(B(x+C))+D$ to help with ordering.
