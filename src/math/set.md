# Set

A collection of different things; a set contains _members_, which can be
mathematical objects of any kind including other sets.

The set with no elements in the **Empty Set**; a set with a single
element is a **Singleton**.

## Notation

Curly brackets are read as "the set of" and the vertical bar $\vert$ is
read as "such that".

$\{ x \vert 10 \le x \lt 30 \}$
