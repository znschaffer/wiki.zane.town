# Inverse Function

## Notation

$f^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse function of $f(x)$

When given the output of $f(x)$, $f^{-1}(x)$ should return the original input of $f(x)$.

## Limitations

When trying to find the inverse of a non
[One-to-One Function](one-to-one-function.md), you'll end up with a
$\pm\sqrt{x}$ which won't be a proper function ( there's two possible
outputs for any input ). To solve this, you need a restricted Domain of
a function to limit the possible outputs - forcing the original function
to be a [One-to-One Function](one-to-one-function.md).

## Switch Method

Use the _x-y switch method_ to easily find the inverse of a function

Example: for $f(x) = 3x+7$ find $f^{-1}(x)$.

1. $y = 3x + 7$
2. switch x and y
3. $x = 3y + 7$
4. solve for y
5. $y = \frac{x-7}{3}$
6. replace y with $f^{-1}(x)$
7. $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x-7}{3}$

## Symmetry

A function and it's inverse are symmetrical across the line $y=x$
