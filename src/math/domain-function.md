# Domain of a Function

The Set of inputs accepted by the function. Notated as $\text{dom}(f)$ where $f$ is the function.

Given a function $f:X\to Y$, the domain of $f$ is $X$.

For a function $f: X \to Y$, the set $Y$ is called the
[Codomain](codomain-function.md) , and the set of values
attained by the function (which is a subset of $Y$) is called its
[Range](range-function.md) or [Image](image-function.md).
