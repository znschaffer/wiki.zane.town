# The Matrix

"What is the matrix"

## Matrix vs Real-World Form

Matrix is _Green_, Real-World is _Blue_.
Matrix is bright with harsh lighting, real-world is uniformly dark.
Costumes are intricate and bold in the Matrix, shaggy rags in real-world.

## Context

Motivation: search for the truth

## Characters

### Neo

Works at _Metacortex_ at the start of the film; software company mega-corp.
Reprimanded for tardiness at work - "every employee must stay in line"

"Personal Jesus Christ" - Choi
Follow the white rabbit

On a search for Morpheus - relates to Trinity.

Gets "bugged" by the agents - a literal stomach bug.

After leaving matrix and 'unplugging' is _dead_ for 3 days and reborn. Sitting on operating table in pure white while angelic music plays.

### Trinity

### Morpheus

### Cypher

### Agent Smith

### Agent Smith

## Agents

They use the police to help them enact control and take custody of Neo and other people not keeping 'in-line'

Bureaucratic looking. Try to convince Neo that Morpheus is evil and dangerous.

Can change the matrix to help them trap the free people. Can change at any point. There's a 'glitch' when they change it - deja vu.

Disgusted by the real humans, they can 'taste their stink, saturated by it'.

They keep "deadnaming" Neo by calling him Mr Anderson

> "My name is "Neo"

## Matrix

Is everywhere, all around us.

Billions of people just living out their lives, oblivious.

The first matrix: design to be perfect - everyone was happy. It didn't work because human beings desire misery and suffering.

Control-based

Built to turn humans into "batteries".

Humans built AI - Machines needed energy, they started growing humans and using them for energy.

Original person was born in the matrix and freed the first people. After he died the prophet saw his return - to free the rest of humanity from the matrix.

Most of these peoples re not ready to be unplugged - they are so in need of the system they'll fight to save it.

The matrix can't tell you who you are.

The solution to this capitalist hell is to shoot your problems away. When Neo and Trinity go to save Morpheus they need to shoot and kill hundreds of people in an office building.

## Zion

Last human city - deep underground. Tank and Dosser were born there.

## Morpheus

Their ship is called the _Nebuchadnezzar_, a Babylonian king whoÂ **conquered Assyria, Egypt, and Judah**, but his most famous conquest is that of Jerusalem, which is recorded in the Bible. Some refer to him as a ruthless, cruel king who destroyed Jerusalem and forced the Jewish people into exile.

Oracle predicts Morpheus will sacrifice his life for new's life. Noe gets to choose which one will die.

_Residual Self Image_ - mental projection of digital self

## Trinity

> "I thought you were a man." -Noe
> "Most men do." - Trinity
